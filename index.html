  <!-- CHAPTER (MARKER SPACES COMPACT) -->
  <div class="chapter">

    <p>
      You know, finding parallel parking spaces can be a hair-pulling experience. We all hate bad parking execution because it affects us and drives us to think, "Darn. I could have parked there had they parked better".
      Let's study bad parking.
      Throughout this article, we are going to explore how much impact you have on other drivers, and we are going to see if we can find a solution to this annoying parking problem.
      <hr />
      First, let's quickly explore parking lines and figure out if they are good solutions for the parking probelm.
      Designating parking spaces might seem like a good idea, but this idea can also potentially waste space. For example, what if everyone at a certain point in time had small compact cars?

    <p class="instruction">
      Click, drag, and park your car on the green area.

      Nice parking job, but look at how much space is being wasted by restricting compact cars to these lines.

  <!-- CHAPTER (MARKER SPACE BIG CAR) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      See how much space is being wasted? We can fit 4 compact cars without the parking lines. Okay, maybe the width between the lines is just too big. Let's shrink it.
    </p>
    <p class="instruction">
      But what if you are driving a larger car?

  <!-- CHAPTER (INTRO) -->
  <div class="chapter">

    <p>
      Congratulations. You now seem like a jerk trying to show off your big, fancy car.
      Okay, maybe we should eliminate parking lines altogether.
      Let's say that you are first to park your car.
      Without parking lines, you have the power to set other drivers up for success when it is their time to park their car.
      You also have the ability to anger a lot of drivers by being <em>that</em> parking jerk. Which one will you be?
    </p>
      Assume that everyone is driving a compact car. Park your car.
      If you acheive the best case, you are a considerate parker.
      If you acheive the worst case, you are a parking jerk.
    <p class="instruction">

      <hr />
      Best case: 4 cars <br />
      Worst case: 3 cars

      We know that in this world, the length of your car can vary from compact to super long.
    </p>
    <p class="instruction">
      Play around with the length parameter and park your car. We will let you know if you're wasting space or not. Let's still assume everyone else is still driving compact cars <hr />
      Best case: 4 cars <br />
      Worst case: 2 car

  <!-- CHAPTER (VARYING LENGTH) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      We also know that in this world, you can't control the length of other people's cars or where they decide to park.
      You can't control the length of other people's cars. You also can't control when and where they park.
      And although you can control where you park, the space that you leave might or might not be enough for others.
      With so many variables, perhaps the most considerate thing to do is to park as far to the sides as possible
    </p>
    <p class="instruction">
      Park your car. You will see that various cars will try their best to park next to you throughout the day.

  <!-- CHAPTER (END) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
       Notice how if you park at one of the ends, more cars will be able to park in the available space throughout the day.
       Cool! Is this the optimal solution for parking since parking lines didn't work out?
       If you were the first person to park, then maybe. But the reality is that sometimes, you have to park around other cars who were there first.
    </p>

    <p class="instruction">
      Scenario: a blue car is parked pretty badly. When you park, the blue car leaves and a yellow car takes its spot.
    </p>
    <iframe id="mini_restriction_intro" playable src="play/mini/mini_restriction_intro.html" width="800" height="385" scrolling="no" style="margin:0 auto;display:block" embedded></iframe>
    <hr />
    <p>
       Notice how the yellow car looks like the parking jerk because the blue car initially parked badly?
       Any passing car will look at the yellow car with disgust even though this was a result from a previous parking job that had nothing to do with the yellow car.
       All of these little games goes to show that there really is no easy way to fix parking since
    </p>
    <p class="closing_statements">
      1. parking lines can be too restrictive that it wastes space <br />
      2. removal of parking lines puts more responsibility on drivers to set up good parking zones <br />
      3. drivers have no choice but to park badly due to previous bad parking jobs
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the problem is that humans should not be trusted with parking and that we should all invest in AI cars. Just kidding (or am I).
      Anywho, the next time you find yourself thinking, "Why can't people just park better?" remember that solving bad parking goes behind "just parking better".
      You should still definitely try to not be the <em>parking jerk</em> whenever you can though because like I said, <br /><strong>I hate bad parking :)</strong>
