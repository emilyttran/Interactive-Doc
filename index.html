      <strong>Please, take the time to park better.</strong>

      You know, finding parallel parking spaces can be a hair-pulling experience. We all hate bad parking execution because it affects us and drives us to think, "I could park there if they parked better".
      Let's study bad parking.
      Throughout this article, we are going to explore how much impact you have on other drivers, and we are going to see if we can find a solution to this annoying parking problem.
      <hr />
      First, let's quickly explore parking lines and figure out if they are good solutions for the parking probelm.
      Designating parking spaces might seem like a good idea, but this idea can also potentially waste space. For example, what if everyone at a certain point in time had small compact cars?

      Click, drag, and park your car on the green area.

      Nice parking job, but look at how much space is being wasted by restricting compact cars to these lines.

  <!-- CHAPTER (MARKER SPACE BIG CAR) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      See how much space is being wasted? We can fit 4 compact cars without the parking lines. Okay, maybe the width between the lines is just too big. Let's shrink it.

      But what if you are driving a larger car?

  <!-- CHAPTER (INTRO) -->

    <p>
      Congratulations. You now seem like a jerk trying to show off your big, fancy car.
      Okay, maybe we should eliminate parking lines altogether.
      Let's say that you are first to park your car.
      Without parking lines, you have the power to set other drivers up for success when it is their time to park their car.
      You also have the ability to anger a lot of drivers by being <em>that</em> parking jerk. Which one will you be?
    </p>
      Assume that everyone is driving a compact car. Park your car.
      If you acheive the best case, you are a considerate parker.
      If you acheive the worst case, you are a parking jerk.
    <p class="instruction">

      Best case: 4 cars <br />
      Worst case: 3 cars

      We know that in this world, the length of your car can vary from compact to super long.

      Play around with the length parameter and park your car. Let's still assume everyone else is still driving compact cars <hr />

      We also know that in this world, you can't control the length of other people's cars or where they decide to park.
      You can't control the length of other people's cars. You also can't control when and where they park.
      And although you can control where you park, the space that you leave might or might not be enough for others.

      As you can see, 4 compact cars can fit in the same amount of space. Therefore, enforcing parking lines is not the absolute solution to the parking problem.
