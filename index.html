      You know, parking is no easy task. We all hate it, but throughout this article, we will try to understand parking problems and see if we can find a solution.
      As you go through each scenario, try to park the car to get both the worst and best case scenario so that you can understand how much impact you have on other drivers.
      Is placement everything? If you want others to park well, does it help to be the parking master yourself first? Let's see. Given that you are first to parallel park, you have the ability to set up how many other cars can park.

      Cool, you have the power to determine how many people can park, especially if you drive a super long car. But what if you are new to parallel parking?

      You might think that the parking problem In this world though, there will be a variation in your car length and padding. Depending on the length and padding of your car,
      future drivers may or may not be able to park. As you play the following game, you'll see that placement still matters.
