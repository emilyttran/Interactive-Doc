  <!-- CHAPTER (INTRO) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      <strong>Please, take the time to park better.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, parking is no easy task. We all hate it, but if we can all be more aware of our parking zones,
      parking will be less of a hair-pulling experience.
      As you go through each scenario, try to park the car to get both the worst and best case scenario so that you can understand how much impact you have on other drivers.
    </p>

    <p class="instruction">
      Where you park is everything. Given that you are first to parallel park, you have the ability to set up how many other cars can park. Click, drag, and release the car to place it. Press the "park" button to park other cars.
      <hr />
      Best case: 4 cars <br />
      Worst case: 3 cars
    </p>

<!-- CHAPTER (LENGTH) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      The length of your car can also affect spacing as well. Evidently, if you drive a MiniCooper, you'll leave more space for other cars.
    </p>
    <p class="instruction">
       What if you drive a super long car? Remember that placement still matters!
      <hr />
      Best case: 3 cars <br />
      Worst case: 2 cars

  <!-- CHAPTER (PADDING) -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <p>
      If you are new to parallel parking, you might want more padding room in front and behind your car.
    </p>
    <p class="instruction">
      Let's say everyone needs max amount padding to comfortably park. The blue line represents the padding zone for your car.

      Best case: 3 cars <br />
      Worst case: 2 cars
