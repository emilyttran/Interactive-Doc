      <strong>Please, take the time to park better.</strong>

      You know, finding parallel parking spaces can be a hair-pulling experience. We all hate bad parking execution because it affects us and drives us to think, "I could park there if they parked better".
      Let's study bad parking.
      Throughout this article, we are going to explore how much impact you have on other drivers, and we are going to see if we can find a solution to this annoying parking problem.
      <hr />
      First, let's quickly explore parking lines and figure out if they are good solutions for the parking probelm.
      Designating parking spaces might seem like a good idea, but this idea can also potentially waste space. For example, what if everyone at a certain point in time had small compact cars?

      Nice parking job, but look at how much space is being wasted by restricting compact cars to these lines.

      See how much space is being wasted? Okay, maybe the spacing width is just too big. Let's shrink it.

      Is placement everything? If you want others to park well, does it help to be the parking master yourself first? Let's see. Given that you are first to parallel park, you have the ability to set up how many other cars can park.

    <p class="instruction">
       Click, drag, and release the car to place it.
        Press the "park" button to park other cars.
        For now, let's see how many compact cars we can fit based on where you park

      Cool, you have the power to determine how many people can park. But what if your car is longer than other cars? Evidently, if you drive a MiniCooper, you'll leave more space for other cars.
      But what if you drive a super long car? Can you still park well?

      Cool, you have the power to determine how many people can park, especially if you drive a super long car. But what if you are new to parallel parking?  You might want more padding room in front and behind your car. Let's say everyone needs max amount padding to comfortably park. Placement still matters though, right?

      The blue line represents the padding zone for your car. Try to acheive the

      You might think that the parking problem In this world though, there will be a variation in your car length and padding. Depending on the length and padding of your car,
      future drivers may or may not be able to park. As you play the following game, you'll see that placement still matters.

      You can't control the length of other people's cars. You also can't control when and where they park. You can only control your own and where you park.

      Click, drag, and park your car. You will see that various cars will park next to you throughout the day, assuming that a driver with a given car length tries their best to fit in the available space.

      As you can see, 4 compact cars can fit in the same amount of space. Therefore, enforcing parking lines is not the absolute solution to the parking problem.
